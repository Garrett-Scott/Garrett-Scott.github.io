    <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p class="tab">
          Welcome! I've been working on this project to answer this question:
        
          How does the human mind enjoy listening to music?
        
        This website will summarize the topic I'm researching, as well as some of the work I've done.

    <h1>Background Information</h1>
    <p class="tab">
        Music combines notes, rhythm, and instrumentation to create a completely unique form of art, and generally most people enjoy listening to it.
      However, everyone has different musical tastes and preferences; some like jazz, or classical, or pop, or any other musical genre you can think of.
      But just because a piece of music is in a certain genre doesn't mean you'll like or dislike it. Every piece of music has other unique attributes such as rhythm, chord progression, melody, harmony, lyrics, instrumentation, and countless other factors that make up a piece of music.
      Music is very qualitative, but one way to measure it is by complexity. Are the notes and rhythms of a piece of music simple and follow a pattern, or are they so complex they sound almost like nonsense?
      Studies have shown that on average people find music of moderate complexity the most enjoyable to listen to. This bell-curve pattern is called the "Wundt Effect".
