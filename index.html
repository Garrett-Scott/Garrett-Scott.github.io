    <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p class="tab">
          Welcome! I've been working on this project to answer this question:
        
          How does the human mind enjoy listening to music?
        
        This website will summarize the topic I'm researching, as well as some of the work I've done.

    <h1>Background Information</h1>
    <p class="tab">
        Music combines notes, rhythm, and instrumentation to create a completely unique form of art, and generally most people enjoy listening to it.
      However, everyone has different musical tastes and preferences; some like jazz, or classical, or pop, or any other musical genre you can think of.
      But just because a piece of music is in a certain genre doesn't mean you'll like or dislike it. Every piece of music has other unique attributes such as rhythm, chord progression, melody, harmony, lyrics, instrumentation, and countless other factors that make up a piece of music.
      Music is very qualitative, but one way to measure it is by complexity. Are the notes and rhythms of a piece of music simple and follow a pattern, or are they so complex they sound almost like nonsense?
      Studies have shown that on average people find music of moderate complexity the most enjoyable to listen to. This bell-curve pattern is called the "Wundt Effect".

    <h2>The Cycle of Listening</h2>
    <p class="tab">
      As you listen to a piece of music, your brain makes predictions about what notes will come next through the cycle shown below. Based on your subconscious experience with music and the parts of a song you've already heard, your brain makes predictions about what will come next.
      As the song continues, your brain's predictions are either reinforced or disproven, and your brain adds this new information into its greater collection of musical knowledge.
      Incorporating this new information, your brain creates another prediction about what will happen next, and the cycle continues. Over time you begin to learn certain patterns and conventions common to certain types or genres of music, and these traits allow you to identify one genre from another.

    <h1>Existing Research</h1>
    <p class="tab">
      There have been many studies done investigating the Wundt Effect described earlier, and here we will look into one that quantifies the different musical preferences between different people.
      This study, "Predictability and Uncertainty in the Pleasure of Music: A Reward for Learning?" <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/39/47/9397.full.pdf">linked here</a> measured the complexity of musical excerpts using statistical measures
      to quantify the Wundt Effect. The figure below showcases the musical preferences of two participants in the study using a statistical measure called Mean Duration-Weighted Information Content (Or mDW-IC for short) to measure the complexity of different musical excerpts. Let's take a look at the chart!
