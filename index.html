    <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p class="tab">
          Welcome! I've been working on this project to answer this question:
        
          How does the human mind enjoy listening to music?
        
        This website will summarize the topic I'm researching, as well as some of the work I've done.

    <h1>Background Information</h1>
    <p class="tab">
        Music combines notes, rhythm, and instrumentation to create a completely unique form of art, and generally most people enjoy listening to it.
      However, everyone has different musical tastes and preferences; some like jazz, or classical, or pop, or any other musical genre you can think of.
      But just because a piece of music is in a certain genre doesn't mean you'll like or dislike it. Every piece of music has other unique attributes such as rhythm, chord progression, melody, harmony, lyrics, instrumentation, and countless other factors that make up a piece of music.
      Music is very qualitative, but one way to measure it is by complexity. Are the notes and rhythms of a piece of music simple and follow a pattern, or are they so complex they sound almost like nonsense?
      Studies have shown that on average people find music of moderate complexity the most enjoyable to listen to. This bell-curve pattern is called the "Wundt Effect". 
    </p>
    <h2>The Cycle of Listening</h2>
    <p class="tab">
      As you listen to a piece of music, your brain makes predictions about what notes will come next through the cycle shown below. Based on your subconscious experience with music and the parts of a song you've already heard, your brain makes predictions about what will come next.
      As the song continues, your brain's predictions are either reinforced or disproven, and your brain adds this new information into its greater collection of musical knowledge.
      Incorporating this new information, your brain creates another prediction about what will happen next, and the cycle continues. Over time you begin to learn certain patterns and conventions common to certain types or genres of music, and these traits allow you to identify one genre from another.

    <h1>Existing Research</h1>
    <p class="tab">
      There have been many studies done investigating the Wundt Effect described earlier, and here we will look into one that quantifies the different musical preferences between different people.
      This study, <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/39/47/9397.full.pdf">"Predictability and Uncertainty in the Pleasure of Music: A Reward for Learning?"</a> had participants listen to a selection of musical excerpts and rate how much they liked each one on a scale from 1 to 7. The study also measured the complexity of musical excerpts using a computer algorithm and quantified the Wundt Effect by correlating the likability and complexity of the excerpts.
      The figure below showcases the musical preferences of two participants in the study using a statistical measure called Mean Duration-Weighted Information Content (Or mDW-IC for short) to measure the complexity of different musical excerpts. Let's take a look at the chart!

            <img src="images/fig2.png" height="422px" width="1024px" />
            <figcaption>Don't worry! This chart looks complicated, but we'll break it down.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    <p class="tab">
      This chart shows how much two participants liked the musical excerpts used in the study. The x-axis shows the complexity (quantified as mDW-IC) of the musical excerpts the participant listened to, with 0 being average complexity, negative numbers being less complex, and positive being more complex.  The y-axis shows how much the participants liked excerpts of that complexity on average.
      The dotted lines then show a parabolic model approximating those preferences. As you can see, both participants have unique preferences; Participant 7 almost exclusively liked music that was slightly less complex than average, while Participant 43 enjoyed a wider range of music.

    <h1>My Work</h1>
    <p class="tab">
      The goal of my project to build on the work done here by finding more factors that affect what music an individual enjoys listening to, such as musical training history, favorite genre, and current mood. In addition, I want to find which genres of music are enjoyed by similar people.
      For example, someone whose favorite genre is Jazz could also like listening to Pop, Classical, or Latin music. Let's look into the specifics of how my study will work.
      </p>
    <h2>How the Study Works</h2>
    <p class='tab'>
      This study will be administered through RedCap, the platform used at Vanderbilt University to administer surveys for scientific studies. Through RedCap, participants will give some background information about themselves. We'll discuss the specific infomation collected later.
      Participants will then listen to two practice musical excerpts and rate each one on a scale of 1 to 10 based on how much they liked it. These practice excerpts are nessessary to make sure the participants are comfortable with the format of the survey before beginning. The participants will then listen through 25 excerpts played in a random order, and rate how much they liked each one.
      After all the data is collected, we will run statistical analyses like the one described earlier to make cool looking charts.

    <h2>Collected Data</h2>
    <p class="tab">
      Privacy is an upmost concern of this study, and no identifiable information such as name, age, or address will be collected. With that said, we will utilize several questionnaires that are found in other academic settings to collect information about the participants.
      Firstly, we will use the Montreal Music History Questionnaire (MMHQ) which asks what musical training you've had in the past, as well as what music you often listen to.
      Next, we will have the Profile of Mood States (POMS) which assess the current mood of the participants. Mood is a factor that could have an effect on how much a person enjoys listening to different types of music, and this questionnaire could lead to some interesting discoveries.
      Finally, we will use the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI) to measure how advanced of a listener each participant is. This information is important, as listening proficiency could have a profound effect on the complexity of music people enjoy listening to.

    <h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
    <p class="tab">
      This project would not be possible without some very amazing people who've helped me along the way.
    </p>
    <p class="tab">
      I would like to thank Dr. Ben Gold, my mentor at Vanderbilt, who's lended me his expertise on this topic and guided me every step of the way.
    </p>
     <p class="tab">
      I would like to thank Dr. Nathan Haag and Dr. Menton Deweese, my advisors at the SSMV, who set up the opportunity for me to work at a Vanderbilt lab and helped me formalize my project. Dr. Haag in particular has helped me more than I deserved to be helped. :)
    </p>
     <p class="tab">
      I would like to thank Dr. Catie Chang, the PI of the NEURDY lab at Vanderbilt, who allowed me to work with them over the last year. 
    </p>
     <p class="tab">
      Finally, I would like to thank the rest of the staff at the SSMV, who have prepared me over the last 4 years to work in a Vanderbilt lab before graduating high school. The SSMV is truly a unique program, and I will always cherish my experience there.
